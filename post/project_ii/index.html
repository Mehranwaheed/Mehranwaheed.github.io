<p>The Electric Load Forecasting project aimed to predict future electric load consumption, a critical aspect for efficient energy management. The project underwent thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset, followed by various preprocessing steps to prepare the data for modeling.</p>
<p>To optimize the performance of the predictive models, a grid search cross-validation approach was employed to fine-tune hyperparameters. Three distinct models, namely Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Feed Forward Neural Network, were evaluated.</p>
<p>In the model comparison, the Decision Tree model demonstrated exceptional performance, outclassing the other models in terms of predictive accuracy. This finding suggests that, in this specific forecasting context, the Decision Tree algorithm provided the most reliable predictions for electric load consumption.</p>
<p>Further insights gained from EDA and model evaluation contribute to the overall success and reliability of the electric load forecasting project.</p>
